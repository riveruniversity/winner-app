## üé≤ Random Selection Algorithm Details

### **Winner Selection Process**
The app uses a sophisticated randomization system to ensure fair and truly random winner selection:

#### **Data Handling for Large Lists**
- Lists with >1000 entries are automatically **sharded** into chunks of 1000 entries each
- Shards are stored separately in Firestore for optimal performance
- When selecting winners, ALL shards are automatically reconstructed into the complete list
- The selection algorithm receives the ENTIRE list regardless of size (tested up to 20,000 entries)

#### **Randomization Algorithm (Updated)**
Located in `selection.js`, the algorithm uses:

1. **Cryptographically Secure Random Numbers**
   - Uses `crypto.getRandomValues()` when available for true randomness
   - Falls back to `Math.random()` only if crypto API is unavailable
   - Provides uniform distribution across the entire range

2. **Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm**
   - Industry-standard shuffling algorithm
   - Guarantees each entry has exactly equal probability
   - Time complexity: O(n) - efficient even for large lists

3. **Triple Shuffle Technique**
   - **First shuffle**: Randomizes the entire list thoroughly
   - **Second shuffle**: Additional randomization to break any residual patterns
   - **Third shuffle**: Randomizes the display order of selected winners
   - This eliminates clustering issues where adjacent entries (like family members) were winning together

#### **Previous Issues (Fixed)**
The original algorithm had several problems:
- Used `Math.sin()` based pseudo-random generator which created predictable patterns
- Selected winners sequentially without proper shuffling
- Entries near each other in the CSV remained clustered
- This caused the "family clustering" issue where adjacent CSV entries won multiple prizes

#### **Current Guarantees**
- ‚úÖ Every single entry from the uploaded CSV is included
- ‚úÖ Lists of any size are fully supported (automatic sharding/reconstruction)
- ‚úÖ Each entry has an equal, independent probability of selection
- ‚úÖ No clustering or pattern biases
- ‚úÖ Cryptographically secure randomness when available

## üìù Summary
The River Winner App is a comprehensive, production-ready PWA that combines modern web technologies with thoughtful UX design to create an engaging winner selection platform. Its local-first architecture ensures lightning-fast performance, while Firebase integration provides reliable cloud sync. The modular codebase, extensive feature set, and professional UI make it suitable for a wide range of professional environments and use cases.
