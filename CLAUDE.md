## üé≤ Random Selection Algorithm Details

### **Winner Selection Process**
The app uses a sophisticated randomization system to ensure fair and truly random winner selection:

#### **Data Handling for Large Lists**
- Lists with >1000 entries are automatically **sharded** into chunks of 1000 entries each
- Shards are stored separately in Firestore for optimal performance
- When selecting winners, ALL shards are automatically reconstructed into the complete list
- The selection algorithm receives the ENTIRE list regardless of size (tested up to 20,000 entries)

#### **Randomization Algorithm (Updated)**
Located in `selection.js`, the algorithm uses:

1. **Cryptographically Secure Random Numbers**
   - Uses `crypto.getRandomValues()` when available for true randomness
   - Falls back to `Math.random()` only if crypto API is unavailable
   - Provides uniform distribution across the entire range

2. **Fisher-Yates Shuffle Algorithm**
   - Industry-standard shuffling algorithm
   - Guarantees each entry has exactly equal probability
   - Time complexity: O(n) - efficient even for large lists

3. **Triple Shuffle Technique**
   - **First shuffle**: Randomizes the entire list thoroughly
   - **Second shuffle**: Additional randomization to break any residual patterns
   - **Third shuffle**: Randomizes the display order of selected winners
   - This eliminates clustering issues where adjacent entries (like family members) were winning together

#### **Previous Issues (Fixed)**
The original algorithm had several problems:
- Used `Math.sin()` based pseudo-random generator which created predictable patterns
- Selected winners sequentially without proper shuffling
- Entries near each other in the CSV remained clustered
- This caused the "family clustering" issue where adjacent CSV entries won multiple prizes

#### **Current Guarantees**
- ‚úÖ Every single entry from the uploaded CSV is included
- ‚úÖ Lists of any size are fully supported (automatic sharding/reconstruction)
- ‚úÖ Each entry has an equal, independent probability of selection
- ‚úÖ No clustering or pattern biases
- ‚úÖ Cryptographically secure randomness when available

#### **texting.js** - SMS Integration
Handles SMS messaging through EZ Texting API. Sends winner notifications, tracks delivery status, and provides batch SMS operations for multiple winners.

#### **reports.js** - Giveaway Reports Integration
Integrates with the Giveaway Reports API to import attendee lists directly. Fetches CSV data from reports, parses and imports as lists, and allows field configuration through CSV dialog.

## üìù Summary
The River Winner App has evolved from a Firebase-based PWA to a containerized, self-hosted solution with local data storage. The refactoring removed external dependencies while maintaining all features and improving performance through batch operations and optimized state management. The app is now deployed at win.revival.com with full Docker containerization and nginx reverse proxy configuration.

Recent updates focused on UI consistency, fixing selection bugs, and ensuring proper data synchronization across browser sessions. The Lists tab now matches the Prizes page design pattern with click-to-select cards, and all async operations have been properly handled to prevent UI refresh issues.
